# Change in plans
Instead of making one giant open-world which causes lag and troubles, we can make make seperate levels on different files (all a variation of one another) and a main terminal to access them. so they can access level one, and perhaps find a chest that they open to unlock level 2, and so on. 


# PlaceCraft
MADE BY PEOPLE IN A PLACE 

# what we are working on now:
- now make a login page (seperate file) that opens the actual game file when done
- make the zombies have zombie skin texture
- add a limit to the distance at which we can place/remove blocks
- make a healthbar and it depreaciates slowly with a smooth countdown (while zombie is touching remove healh by 1, wait 0.5 seconds, repeat) when a zombie is touching you.
- add a animatino when the zombie hits you
- MAKE THE WOLD GENERATION NOT FLAT, CUSTOM
