# PlaceCraft
MADE BY PEOPLE IN A PLACE 

# what we are working on now:
- now make a login page (seperate file) that opens the actual game file when done
- make the zombies have zombie skin texture
- add a limit to the distance at which we can place/remove blocks
- make a healthbar and it depreaciates slowly with a smooth countdown (while zombie is touching remove healh by 1, wait 0.5 seconds, repeat) when a zombie is touching you.
